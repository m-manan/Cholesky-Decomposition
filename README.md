## Abstract

Linear Systems involving sparse, symmetric and positive defined matrices occur in many practical applications, such as in computer vision,fluid dynamics or electromagnetism.
We suppose our company needs to solve such systems via the Cholesky method, and has asked us to find the best programming environment for this task: should a reliable paid environment such as MATLAB be preferred, or is it worth investigating into free open-source alternatives? Also, does the choice of operating system matters?
